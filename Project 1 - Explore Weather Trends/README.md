# Explore Weather Trends

## Introduction
In this project I took the following steps:
- Extracted my data from a database using a SQL query
- Calculated a moving average in an Excel spreadsheet
- Created a line chart in the Excel spreadsheet

## Observations
- On average, Edinburgh is much cooler than the world.
- The average temperature difference between Edinburgh and the world is 0.756°C. 
- The biggest difference was 1.37°C in 1881, and in 1835 Edinburgh was actually 0.17°C hotter than the world.
- Overall, the world seems to be getting hotter and the linear trendline verifies this. 
    - In 1743, the global linear trendline intercepts the y-axis at around 7.7°C and in 2015 this intercept is around 9°C. The temperature increases at around 0.46°C every 100 years.
    - In comparison Edinburgh started at 7.1°C and is just above 8°C. The world temperature increases at around 0.33°C every 100 years.
- Since around 1986 the global temperature has consistently been above the trendline. This is probably due to global warming.
- Global and local data increase and decrease together, they are 81% correlated. However, there is a strange period between 1790 and 1810 where the world temperature is increasing, while Edinburgh’s is decreasing.
